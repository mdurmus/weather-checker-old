<h2>Logic Flow</h2>

Starting to design my project with a flowchart has helped me a lot. First, these diagrams helped me understand my code better and simplify complex logic. The flow of logic with visually represented figures helped me to see the operations more clearly and better understand how the code works. Secondly, the flowcharts made it easier for me to identify potential error points and get through the debugging process more easily.

**There may be some differences because I drew the flowchart before I started my project.**
